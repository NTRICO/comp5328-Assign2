# requirements.txt (CUDA 13.0 build for PyTorch)
# Installs GPU-enabled torch/torchvision matching your NVIDIA driver (CUDA 13.0).
# If install fails, change 'cu130' below to 'cu128' or 'cu126' and retry.

# Core
torch
torchvision
numpy
tqdm
matplotlib
pillow
cython
tensorboard

# Notes:
# - Keep the two index lines at the top so pip pulls CUDA wheels for torch/torchvision
# - Other packages come from PyPI via the extra index
# - You didn't import torchaudio, so it's omitted.
